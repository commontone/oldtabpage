# oldtabpage
A new tab page that gets back to basics. Or whatever. I'm just sick of the current options.
## Usage
To use this (very basic) extension, since it's not on the Extension site yet, do this:
Download all the files into a directory "A" or clone it. This directory should now contain all the files, like manifest.json.
Now, go to chrome://extensions/ .
Click "Load unpacked extension..."
Navigate to this directory, select it, and click ok.
You might have to confirm something. But, after that, your new tab page should be different.
